# DungeonDra - Project Overview

## Vision Statement
DungeonDra is the definitive single-player D&D experience that brings the magic of tabletop RPGs to the digital world through intelligent AI storytelling and immersive 3D dice mechanics.

## Technical Philosophy

### Architecture Principles
1. **Domain-Driven Design**: D&D rules are the source of truth
2. **Clean Architecture**: Business logic isolated from frameworks
3. **SOLID Principles**: Every class has a single, well-defined responsibility
4. **Fail-Safe Design**: Graceful degradation when external services fail

### Core Constraints
- **Performance First**: 60fps animations, <3s AI response times
- **Spanish-Only UX**: Complete localization for Spanish-speaking users
- **No External Dependencies**: Self-contained except for Gemini AI
- **TypeScript Strict**: Zero `any` types, complete type safety

## System Boundaries

### What DungeonDra IS:
- ✅ Single-player D&D adventure generator
- ✅ Complete character management system
- ✅ Immersive dice rolling experience
- ✅ AI-powered narrative engine
- ✅ Full D&D 5e combat mechanics

### What DungeonDra IS NOT:
- ❌ Multiplayer platform
- ❌ Character sheet editor for external games
- ❌ Complete D&D rulebook implementation
- ❌ Social/sharing platform
- ❌ Mobile-first application

## Quality Gates

### Code Quality
- TypeScript strict mode passing
- ESLint zero warnings
- All domain entities have validation
- Use cases have error handling
- Components have proper TypeScript interfaces

### User Experience
- Spanish language throughout
- Accessible color contrast
- Keyboard navigation support
- Loading states for all async operations
- Error messages in plain Spanish

### Performance
- Bundle size <500KB gzipped
- First paint <2 seconds
- Dice animations smooth at 60fps
- AI requests timeout after 10 seconds
- Hot reload <500ms in development

### Business Logic
- All D&D calculations accurate to 5e rules
- Character creation follows official constraints
- Combat mechanics handle edge cases
- Story generation maintains narrative consistency
- Dice probabilities are mathematically correct

## Risk Mitigation

### Technical Risks
1. **Gemini AI Unavailability**
   - Mitigation: Retry logic + fallback content
   - Fallback: Pre-written story templates

2. **Animation Performance**
   - Mitigation: CSS-based animations with GPU acceleration
   - Fallback: Simple fade transitions

3. **TypeScript Complexity**
   - Mitigation: Strict interfaces at layer boundaries
   - Standard: Zero `any` types allowed

### Product Risks
1. **User Engagement**
   - Mitigation: Story quality metrics tracking
   - Goal: >20 minutes average session time

2. **Technical Debt**
   - Mitigation: Regular refactoring sprints
   - Standard: Clean Architecture principles enforced

## Success Metrics

### Technical KPIs
- Zero TypeScript errors in production build
- <3 seconds average API response time
- 99.9% uptime for local services
- <2MB total memory usage

### User KPIs
- <5 minutes to complete first adventure
- >80% users create multiple characters
- >90% completion rate for started adventures
- <5% error rate in user workflows
